How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, React.js

I was able to implement states, hooks, data fetching, and JSX in my code to build this movie database.

Optimizations

I could always include more information on the movie when clicked. For instance, instead of just the movies populating I could include details about the movie such as a short description, actors,producer, and even the rating of the film.!

Lessons Learned:

React JS is a great supplement to Javascript. It allow developers to create fast and efficient single page applications much quicker than vanilla Javascript.

File and folder structure is the extremely important when it comes to utilizing build native react applications and mobile apps as well.

Ensure that you set up your environment properly before hand! The easiest way to do so us using the npx create-react-app./ command.

Also, JSX is extremely useful (although not necessary) when it comes rendering the UI of our page.

This was my first encounter with React!
